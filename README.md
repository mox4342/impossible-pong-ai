# Impossible Pong AI

**Think you're good at Pong? Think again.**

Face off against an AI opponent with 91% accuracy, lightning-fast reflexes, and adaptive strategies. This isn't your parents' Pong - with speeds reaching 3x normal, ice-shot freeze mechanics, and an AI that learns from your play style, victory is *technically* possible... but highly unlikely.

**Win rate: <2%** | Most players: 0-7 | Your best chance: "SO CLOSE!"

## ⚡ What Makes It Impossible?

- **Adaptive AI**: Gets harder when you're doing well, slightly easier when you're struggling (but you won't notice)
- **Progressive Speed**: Rallies accelerate from manageable to insane (up to 30px/sec)
- **Strategic AI**: Uses freeze shots at the worst possible moments
- **Psychological Warfare**: Taunts, confidence meters, and "almost had it" moments keep you playing

## 🎮 Features

- **Ice Shot Mechanic**: Press E to freeze your opponent for 1.5 seconds (5-second cooldown)
- **Debug Mode**: Press D to see the AI's decision-making in real-time
- **Fair Serves**: After each point, speed resets to give you a fighting chance
- **Instant Replay**: Space bar immediately starts a new game - no menus, no waiting
- **Session Tracking**: Watch your improvement (or descent into madness)

## 🕹️ Controls

- **W/S** - Move paddle up/down
- **E** - Fire ice shot 
- **Space** - Start/Pause/Instant Retry
- **D** - Toggle AI debug visualization
- **P** - Practice mode (for cowards)
- **M** - Mute

## 🏆 Can You Beat It?

The AI is beatable... technically. We've seen it happen. Once. Maybe twice. The question isn't *if* you can win, but *how many attempts* it will take. 

Current record: 147 attempts for first victory.

**Warning**: This game is intentionally frustrating and surprisingly addictive. "Just one more game" may turn into an hour.
